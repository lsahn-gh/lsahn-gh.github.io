            esBPF project has been over one year and it began with the idea that Is it worth filtering ingress packets on Software-Offload layer instead of Network Stack? Software-Offload is similar to Hardware-Offload, but it works in ethernet driver. Now time to do Stress-testing since its prototype was released and the comparison object will be iptables.
Before walking through the article, let me define a few short terms against typing exhausting long terms,

            Q. 아래와 같이 startup point에서 MMU 와 D-Cache의 상태가 off 여야 하는데 이유가 뭔가요? 1 // &amp;#39;head.S&amp;#39; of linux kernel 5.10 2 /* 3* Kernel startup entry point. 4* --------------------------- 5* 6* The requirements are: 7* MMU = off, D-cache = off, I-cache = on or off, 8* x0 = physical address to the FDT blob. 9* 10* This code is mostly position independent so you call this at 11* __pa(PAGE_OFFSET).

            Hello, everyone!
There is a meetup named Cron-a-thon held by Ubuntu-KR Daejeon team every 2 weeks. However, I put the workshop on the table at the meetup 3 months ago. The administrators and I talked about the organization of an event for the beginners who were into how to build a GTK+ application in Python. That was the beginning of the workshop.
Before we talk about the workshop, let&#39;s look at goods a bit.
