            Hello, everyone!
There is a meetup named Cron-a-thon held by Ubuntu-KR Daejeon team every 2 weeks. However, I put the workshop on the table at the meetup 3 months ago. The administrators and I talked about the organization of an event for the beginners who were into how to build a GTK+ application in Python. That was the beginning of the workshop.
Before we talk about the workshop, let&#39;s look at goods a bit.
