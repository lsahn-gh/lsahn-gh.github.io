            esBPF project has been over one year and it began with the idea that Is it worth filtering ingress packets on Software-Offload layer instead of Network Stack? Software-Offload is similar to Hardware-Offload, but it works in ethernet driver. Now time to do Stress-testing since its prototype was released and the comparison object will be iptables.
Before walking through the article, let me define a few short terms against typing exhausting long terms,

            Whole processes, git cloning the right codebase from a repository, installing all the packages, kernel configuration, and finally go building are such a challenge for beginners like me. Fortunately, Ubuntu Kernel Team provides an easy system for building kernel though.
In this article, we are going to look at some requirements. In more detail, try installing build tools, get ready, and building :-)
Get ready for upstream kernel and environment Canonical, a company mainly supports Ubuntu distro maintains its Kernel sources at Launchpad, but for Raspberry Pi, it&#39;s maintained at this repository.

            Q. 아래와 같이 startup point에서 MMU 와 D-Cache의 상태가 off 여야 하는데 이유가 뭔가요? 1 // &amp;#39;head.S&amp;#39; of linux kernel 5.10 2 /* 3* Kernel startup entry point. 4* --------------------------- 5* 6* The requirements are: 7* MMU = off, D-cache = off, I-cache = on or off, 8* x0 = physical address to the FDT blob. 9* 10* This code is mostly position independent so you call this at 11* __pa(PAGE_OFFSET).
